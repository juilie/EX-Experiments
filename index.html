    <p>
        Here are some links to design and code experiments to start picking a direction for the website.

    <ul>
        <li>Busy meowmix inspired: spent the most time on this one, it's a bit busy, but it's the most complete. 
            <ul>   
                <li><a href="./occlusionColorDither/">Color Scheme 1</a></li>
                <li><a href="./occlusionColor/">Color Scheme 2</a></li>
                <li><a href="./occlusionWhite/">Color Scheme 3</a></li>
            </ul>
    </li>
        <li><a href="./card/">Texture shiny card thing</a> - This is underdeveloped, takes a moment to load right now - It's more hifi and agency-y. I do like the motif of the ring surrounded by colorful cubes and might make a draft playing with that more.
